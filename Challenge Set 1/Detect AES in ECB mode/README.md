`ctexts.txt` In this file are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.

One of them has been encrypted with ECB.

Detect it.

Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and deterministic; the same 16 byte plaintext block will always produce the same 16 byte ciphertext.

So let's begin!

First of all we have to understand what ECB actually is...

Do you see this image?

Can you recognize what it shows?

If no,then go to a doctor to check you eyes :P ,
but if you do, then this is because this image was encrypted with AES ECB. That means every pixel of the image was encrypted with the same key.

So if a pixel has the same color with another pixel, then the encrypted result will be the same.

Let's say we encrypt 'Hello' with AES ECB 128bit with the key `1234567891234567` which is 16bit key.

The result will be `3892EFAB6427AB1568092CD2262387D5` always.

So let's say black color pixels have value 'B', then if we encrypt it with key `1234567891234567`, then I will get `BC395B3316D18C490C4BABE2E6F81912` always.
